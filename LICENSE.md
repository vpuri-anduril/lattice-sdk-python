Lattice system files, packaged APIs, and Anduril APIs add-ons) is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The 
License Agreement forms a legally binding contract between you and Anduril in relation to your use of the SDK.  
  - 1.4  A  "compatible  implementation"  means  any  use  that  (i)  is  compatible  with  Lattice;  or  (ii)  successfully  is  validated  by  Anduril  to  be
