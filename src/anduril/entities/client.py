        Publish an entity for ingest into the Entities API. Entities created with this method are "owned" by the originator: other sources,
        such as the UI, may not edit or delete these entities. The server validates entities at API call time and
        returns an error if the entity is invalid.

        An entity ID must be provided when calling this endpoint. If the entity referenced by the entity ID does not exist
        then it will be created. Otherwise the entity will be updated. An entity will only be updated if its
        provenance.sourceUpdateTime is greater than the provenance.sourceUpdateTime of the existing entity.

        Parameters
        ----------
        entity_id : typing.Optional[str]
            A Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) for your entity. If this field is empty, the Entity Manager API
             automatically generates an ID when it creates the entity.

        description : typing.Optional[str]
            A human-readable entity description that's helpful for debugging purposes and human
             traceability. If this field is empty, the Entity Manager API generates one for you.

        is_live : typing.Optional[bool]
            Indicates the entity is active and should have a lifecycle state of CREATE or UPDATE.
             Set this field to true when publishing an entity.

        created_time : typing.Optional[dt.datetime]
            The time when the entity was first known to the entity producer. If this field is empty, the Entity Manager API uses the
             current timestamp of when the entity is first received.
             For example, when a drone is first powered on, it might report its startup time as the created time.
             The timestamp doesn't change for the lifetime of an entity.

        expiry_time : typing.Optional[dt.datetime]
            Future time that expires an entity and updates the is_live flag.
             For entities that are constantly updating, the expiry time also updates.
             In some cases, this may differ from is_live.
             Example: Entities with tasks exported to an external system must remain
             active even after they expire.
             This field is required when publishing a prepopulated entity.
             The expiry time must be in the future, but less than 30 days from the current time.

        status : typing.Optional[Status]
            Human-readable descriptions of what the entity is currently doing.

        location : typing.Optional[Location]
            Geospatial data related to the entity, including its position, kinematics, and orientation.

        location_uncertainty : typing.Optional[LocationUncertainty]
            Indicates uncertainty of the entity's position and kinematics.

        geo_shape : typing.Optional[GeoShape]
            Geospatial representation of the entity, including entities that cover an area rather than a fixed point.

        geo_details : typing.Optional[GeoDetails]
            Additional details on what the geospatial area or point represents, along with visual display details.

        aliases : typing.Optional[Aliases]
            Entity name displayed in the Lattice UI side panel. Also includes identifiers that other systems can use to reference the same entity.

        tracked : typing.Optional[Tracked]
            If this entity is tracked by another entity, this component contains data related to how it's being tracked.

        correlation : typing.Optional[Correlation]
            If this entity has been correlated or decorrelated to another one, this component contains information on the correlation or decorrelation.

        mil_view : typing.Optional[MilView]
            View of the entity.

        ontology : typing.Optional[Ontology]
            Ontology defines an entity's categorization in Lattice, and improves data retrieval and integration. Builds a standardized representation of the entity.

        sensors : typing.Optional[Sensors]
            Details an entity's available sensors.

        payloads : typing.Optional[Payloads]
            Details an entity's available payloads.

        power_state : typing.Optional[PowerState]
            Details the entity's power source.

        provenance : typing.Optional[Provenance]
            The primary data source provenance for this entity.

        overrides : typing.Optional[Overrides]
            Provenance of override data.

        indicators : typing.Optional[Indicators]
            Describes an entity's specific characteristics and the operations that can be performed on the entity.
             For example, "simulated" informs the operator that the entity is from a simulation, and "deletable"
             informs the operator (and system) that the delete operation is valid against the entity.

        target_priority : typing.Optional[TargetPriority]
            The prioritization associated with an entity, such as if it's a threat or a high-value target.

        signal : typing.Optional[Signal]
            Describes an entity's signal characteristics, primarily used when an entity is a signal of interest.

        transponder_codes : typing.Optional[TransponderCodes]

        such as the UI, may not edit or delete these entities. The server validates entities at API call time and
        returns an error if the entity is invalid.

        An entity ID must be provided when calling this endpoint. If the entity referenced by the entity ID does not exist
        then it will be created. Otherwise the entity will be updated. An entity will only be updated if its
        provenance.sourceUpdateTime is greater than the provenance.sourceUpdateTime of the existing entity.

        Parameters
        ----------
        entity_id : typing.Optional[str]
            A Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) for your entity. If this field is empty, the Entity Manager API
             automatically generates an ID when it creates the entity.

        description : typing.Optional[str]
            A human-readable entity description that's helpful for debugging purposes and human
             traceability. If this field is empty, the Entity Manager API generates one for you.

        is_live : typing.Optional[bool]
            Indicates the entity is active and should have a lifecycle state of CREATE or UPDATE.
             Set this field to true when publishing an entity.

        created_time : typing.Optional[dt.datetime]
            The time when the entity was first known to the entity producer. If this field is empty, the Entity Manager API uses the
             current timestamp of when the entity is first received.
             For example, when a drone is first powered on, it might report its startup time as the created time.
             The timestamp doesn't change for the lifetime of an entity.

        expiry_time : typing.Optional[dt.datetime]
            Future time that expires an entity and updates the is_live flag.
             For entities that are constantly updating, the expiry time also updates.
             In some cases, this may differ from is_live.
             Example: Entities with tasks exported to an external system must remain
             active even after they expire.
             This field is required when publishing a prepopulated entity.
             The expiry time must be in the future, but less than 30 days from the current time.

        status : typing.Optional[Status]
            Human-readable descriptions of what the entity is currently doing.

        location : typing.Optional[Location]

        location_uncertainty : typing.Optional[LocationUncertainty]
            Indicates uncertainty of the entity's position and kinematics.

        geo_shape : typing.Optional[GeoShape]
            Geospatial representation of the entity, including entities that cover an area rather than a fixed point.

        geo_details : typing.Optional[GeoDetails]
            Additional details on what the geospatial area or point represents, along with visual display details.

        aliases : typing.Optional[Aliases]
            Entity name displayed in the Lattice UI side panel. Also includes identifiers that other systems can use to reference the same entity.

        tracked : typing.Optional[Tracked]
            If this entity is tracked by another entity, this component contains data related to how it's being tracked.

        correlation : typing.Optional[Correlation]
            If this entity has been correlated or decorrelated to another one, this component contains information on the correlation or decorrelation.

        mil_view : typing.Optional[MilView]
            View of the entity.

        ontology : typing.Optional[Ontology]
            Ontology defines an entity's categorization in Lattice, and improves data retrieval and integration. Builds a standardized representation of the entity.

        sensors : typing.Optional[Sensors]
            Details an entity's available sensors.

        payloads : typing.Optional[Payloads]
            Details an entity's available payloads.

        indicators : typing.Optional[Indicators]
            Describes an entity's specific characteristics and the operations that can be performed on the entity.
             For example, "simulated" informs the operator that the entity is from a simulation, and "deletable"
             informs the operator (and system) that the delete operation is valid against the entity.

        target_priority : typing.Optional[TargetPriority]
            The prioritization associated with an entity, such as if it's a threat or a high-value target.

        signal : typing.Optional[Signal]

        This is a long polling API that will first return all pre-existing data and then return all new data as

        If you want to retrieve the next batch of results from an existing polling session then send the session
        token you received from the server in the request body. If no new data is available then the server will
        hold the connection open for up to 5 minutes. After the 5 minute timeout period, the server will close the
        connection with no results and you may resume polling with the same session token. If your session falls behind

        ----------
        session_token : str
